## Hello, I'm Jian Jie. I create delightfully thoughtful products through code & design.
<br/>
My focus is in designing and building iOS apps and websites. I involve myself in user interface design and primarily code in Swift and Objective-C for iOS, but I am also adept at front-end web development.

I'm currently serving national service and will not be able to commit to any full-time positions. However, I'm always
keen to talk about all things design and tech!

a message at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
