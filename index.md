## Hello, I'm Jian Jie. I create delightfully thoughtful products through code & design.
<br/>
I involve myself in user interface design and primarily code in Swift and Objective-C for iOS. However, I am also 
adept at front-end web development.

I'm currently serving national service and will not be able to commit to any full-time positions. However, I'm always 
keen to talk about all things design and tech!

Feel free to tweet me at [@{{ site.twitter.username }}](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter.username }}) or email me 
at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
