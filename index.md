## Hello, I'm Jian Jie. I create delightfully thoughtful products through code & design.
<br/>
My focus is in building apps, webapps and chat bots using modern libraries, frameworks and languages. Occasionally (and when permissible), I like to involve myself in user interface and user experience design as well.

I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor of Computing (Honours) in Computer Science at National University of Singapore, School of Computing.

a message at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
