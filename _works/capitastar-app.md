{{ page.title }} is a mobile app that helps shoppers make the most of their shopping experience within all Capitaland 
malls in Singapore. It was developed by [buUuk](http://www.buuuk.com) while I was having an internship there. I was 
involved in coding most of the user-interface and some networking-related stuff for the iOS app.
