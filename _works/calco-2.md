Calco is a simple scientific calculator built for amazing productivity. It was
built with the familiarity of its physical counterparts together with features
that make good use of the capabilities of your iPhone.

It does not do any fancy (and arguably useless) stuff, but it takes the most
frequently-used features of a basic scientific calculator and perfected its
interaction. It solves many of the frustrations of the typical calculator app
you see on the App Store.

### What Calco Isn't

Calco isn't that shitty themed calculator that does nothing more than the
stock calculator app. Check out this short playlist of videos that demonstrate
its capabilities:
