<p class="lead">Hello! I'm Jian Jie, I create delightful products through code & design.</p>

I involve myself in user interface design and primarily code in Swift and Objective-C. However, I am also adept at 
front-end web development.

I'm currently serving national service and will not be able to commit to any full-time positions. However, I'm always 
keen to talk about all things design and tech!
