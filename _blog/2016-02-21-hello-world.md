## Hello world
I grew up at a time when personal computers just got mainstream and it was a pretty common sight in most Singaporean 
households. Back then my dad got one for family use and it came with Microsoft Office 2000 pre-installed. The 8 
year-old me then discovered the magic of Powerpointâ€”I could easily create interative animations, it was nothing short 
of amazing. I found joy in creating and spent a lot of my after-school evenings building tiny projects and showing 
them off to my friends. It was my first foray into interaction design.

In my late pre-teens, I began picking up some [scripting languages](http://www.autohotkey.com) to further a nefarious 
intent to cheat in an online first-person shooter game. During that period I discovered that coding was a quick and 
easy way to realise a vision. It was obvious to me that a seed of an idea and an easy means build stuff could be 
really life-changing.

Fast forward to today, I am coding in Swift, Objective-C and learning other modern web stacks. Although it may seem a 
whole lot different from the past, the fundementals had always been the same: I simply turn my ideas into reality. 
The only difference is in the execution.

## A formal hello
So who am I and what do I do? I am an ordinary Singaporean bloke who enjoys creating delightfully thoughful products 
wherein design and code are just but some means to achieve my vision and ideals.

I will be using this space to share my thoughts and journey as a building products.
